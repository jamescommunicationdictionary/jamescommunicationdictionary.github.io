# Yes
James will sign "yes" in response to some questions. They have to be quite direct questions, e.g. do you want cereal, while holding the cereal. You need to be careful because sometimes he will just sign "yes" to make you stop asking him questions.

# No
In general James won't say "no" in response to a question, he will just ignore you. But he might say "no" in response to someone else saying "no".
