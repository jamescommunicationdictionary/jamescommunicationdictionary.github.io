James likes meeting new people (especially dog walkers). He has a few words that he uses consistently. 

# Hello


# Aaah

James uses 'aaah' for hugs, babies, dogs or other animals. He sometimes uses it for 'goodbye' because people hug when they say goodbye!

# Goodbye 


James will wave bye bye. Sometimes this is only a very small hand movement and hard to spot!
