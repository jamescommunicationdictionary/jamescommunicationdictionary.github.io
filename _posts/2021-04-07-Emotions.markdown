James can ususally make his emotions known but here is a few noises that may be useful. 
# Funny

# Flapping

James flaps like many on the autistic spectrum - it is generally an excited emotion.

# Screaching

James will 'screach'. This stim is can be an excited noise but can move into overwhelemed or overstimulated.

# Hitting the back of his head

This stim is quite common if he is getting overstimulated, frustrated or you ask him to do something. He has never hit hard enough for this to be a concern but it is something to watch for.

# Hugs 
Aaah is used for hugs, babies, dogs or other animals. It is a way of showing love!

# Oh no!

James loves the dramatic and lots of things are "oh no". He often likes you to say "oh no"/"oh dear"/ "whats happened?" back to him.
