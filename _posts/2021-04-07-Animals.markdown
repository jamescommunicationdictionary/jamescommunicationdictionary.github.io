James likes animals!

# Pig

James will sign pig for just about any animal!


# Dog

James has a dog - called Jet - and so there are lots of words he uses round dogs. Generally his word for dog is a panting noise!



## Ball

James makes a 'Blblblbl' noise for ball ( and bubble and sometimes balloon)

# Aaaah 

James uses 'aaah' for hugs, babies, dogs or other animals. In the context of animals it is generally in reference to stroking the animal.
