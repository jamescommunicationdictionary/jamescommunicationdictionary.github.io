James loves food! Sausages and any form of potatoe could be eaten all day long! He has a few food words which we capture here

# Drink

If James wants more to drink he will make a slurping noise. He want necessarily get someones attention before making this noise and may do it very quietly. 

If you think you hear it, it is worth checking he has a drink. He is getting a bit better and answering 'yes' or just ignoring you for no, if asked if he wants a drink.
